#### Coding Interview - Approach
1. Restate the question, give a basic example and an expected answer
2. Does a solution exist? Is it unique? How many solutions can there be and how do we 
choose which one to return?
3. Define constraints for all inputs
4. Define edge cases. What's an expected output?
5. Do we care about runtime, space or both (or neither)?
6. Solve

# LeetCode - Top Interview Questions
Solutions to [**LeetCode - Top Interview Questions**](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/)

- [x] Two Sum (Easy)
- [x] Add Two Numbers (Medium)
> You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The
digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 
0 itself.

> e.g. `l1 = 2 -> 4 -> 3`, `l2 = 5 -> 6 -> 4` gives `7 -> 0 -> 8`

_Iterate through both linked lists simultaneously while any of them is non-empty.
Add digits and carry a "carry" to the next operation in case of overflow_  

- [x] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium)
> Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating 
characters. Examples:
```
"abcabcbb" -> 3
"bbbbb" -> 1
"pwwkew" -> 3
"abba" -> 2
```

_TLDR: Keep two pointers `i, j` (`j >= i`) of the longest "unique" substring 
ending in `j`._

_Iterate through each char in `s` keeping a map `char -> idx` to be able to discover a 
duplicate (and its index). If came across a duplicate, update the map with its `idx`. 
Keep track of two indices: `i, j` (`j >= i`) that note the beginning and end of the 
"unique" string ending in `j`._

_If a new `char` does not exist in the map, move `j`_

_If a new `char` exists in the map, move `i` to the right of the existing duplicate
and calculate the length of the substring starting in `i` ending in `j`. Keep track
of the running `max` of the longest substring._

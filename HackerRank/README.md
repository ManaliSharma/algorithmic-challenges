Solutions to selected questions taken from _Hackerrank - Cracking the Coding Interview Challenges_ and _HackerRank - Interview Preparation Kit_.    
  
## Arrays  
 - [x] 2D Array - DS  
 - [x] Arrays: Left rotation  
 > A _left rotation_ operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements unit to the left.
 - [x] New Year Chaos  
 - [x] Minimum Swaps 2  
 > You need to find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.   
 - [x] Array Manipulation


## Dictionaries and Hashmaps  
- [x] Hash Tables: Ransom Note
> Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print `Yes` if he can replicate his ransom note _exactly_ using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print `No`.

 _Insert each word from `magazine` to a dict (char as a `key` and counter as a `value`) and then, for each word in `ransom note` check if the word is available._   

- [x] Two Strings
> Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.
 
 _It is enough to check if strings share at least one common letter._

 - [x] Sherlock and Anagrams
 > Two strings are anagrams of each other if the letters of one string can be rearranged to form the other string.
 Given a string, find the number of pairs of substrings of the string that are anagrams of each other.
 
 _For each substring, sort its letters it and store the counter for each sorted substring in a hash map. Then for each element in the hash map
 calculate the number of anagrams, which can be interpreted as a number of connections with other identical sorted substrings 
 (number of connections between the vertices of the polygon, i.e. n(n-1)/2)._
 
 
 ## Dynamic Programming
- [x] Max Array Sum
> Given an array of integers, find the subset of non-adjacent elements with the maximum sum.
Calculate the sum of that subset.

_Bottom up solution: Build an array (dynamically) that, at each position, holds a maximum sum of the original
array up to that position. For each next element (at position `i`) the maximum sum will either be a) the element itself,
b) previous max sum (at position `i-1`), or c) sum of that  element and the maximum sum at position `i-2`._

- [x] Candies
> Alice is a kindergarten teacher. She wants to give some candies to the children in her class. 
All the children sit in a line and each of them has a rating score according to his or her performance
in the class.  Alice wants to give at least 1 candy to each child. If two children sit next to each
other, then the one with the higher rating must get more candies. Alice wants to minimize the total 
umber of candies she must buy.

_Create two arrays: `left_to_right` and `right_to_left`. The first array will keep the amount of candies
such that each child with higher score than its left neighbour will have more candies. The other array
ensures the reverse. The return value will be the max of the two at each position. Note that this solution
is `O(N)` in both time and space and there exists a solution that is `O(1)` in space:

 - [x] DFS: Connected Cell in a Grid
 - [x] Find Nearest Clone
 > In this challenge, there is a connected undirected graph where each of the
nodes is a color. Given a color, find the shortest path connecting any two
nodes of that color. Each edge has a weight of 1. If there is not a pair or if
the color is not found, print -1.

_For each node of required color, perform a BFS, finding a minimum
distance from that node to the other one of the same colour. Then return
the smallest of all distances found, or zero if no distance is positive_

- [x] Linked Lists: Detect a cycle      
> Given a linked list detect if it contains a cycle.

 _Use Floyd's cycle detection algorithm - create two pointers, one (slow) jumping from list to the next node, the second one (quick) jumping to every 2nd node. If they eventually meet, there is a loop._    

- [x] Inserting a Node Into a Sorted Doubly Linked List

## Search  
 - [x] Hash Tables: Ice cream parlor      
> Given list of integers, find two of them that sum to n.  
  
_Iterate through the list once and add each value to the dict if it does not already contain an element that, when added, gives a sum of n._   

- [x] Swap Nodes   
> Build a Binary Tree and swap children of nodes at particular depths.
After each round of swapping, traverse the tree in-order and print the values of nodes.

_Build a tree using queue, for each pair of children to be inserted, pop a parent from the queue
and add children to it._

 > Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.  
 - [x] Sorting: Comparator      
 > Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.

>Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of toys Mark can buy?

- [x] Merge Sort: Counting Inversions
> Given `d` datasets, print the number of inversions that must be swapped to sort each dataset on a new line.

_Use Merge Sort_
  
## Stacks and Queues  
 - [x] Stacks: Balanced brackets      
 > Given a string of brackets `{}[]()` state if they are balanced or not.
 
 _Push each bracket on the stack and pop if found the matching one. If closing bracket does not match the one on the top of the stack - Return `False`._    
 - [x] Queues: A tale of two stacks      
> Build a queue using two stacks.  
  
  _There are two methods: 1) make `push` operation costly and 2) make `pop` operation costly._  
 *1) Push operation costly*  
 **`push`**      
 _- while first stack is not empty - put all elements from the first stack on the second one,_      
 _- push the element on the first stack,_      
 _- move all elements back from the second stack to the first one._      
 **`pop`**      
 _- if the first stack is empty - return `Error`,_      
 _- else `pop` the element from the first stack._  
 
  *2) Pop operation costly*  
   **`push`**  
  _- insert an element to the first stack,_      
 **`pop`**      
 _- if both stacks are empty - return `Error`,_      
 _- if second stack is empty - put all elements from the first stack on the second stack,_      
 _- pop the element from the second stack._
 
 - [x] Stacks: A tale of two queues      
> Build a stack using two queues  
  
  _There are again two methods: 1) make `push` operation costly and 2) make `pop` operation costly._  
  _1) Make push operation costly_  
  **`push`**  
  _- enqueue element to second queue,_  
  _- move all elements 
   the first queue to the second one,_  
   _- swap queues' names (to avoid the necessity of moving elements back to the first queue._
   
   _2) Make pop operation costly_  
   **`push`**  
   _- enqueue element to the first queue_  
   **`pop`**  
   _- move all elements (except the last one) from the first queue to the second one,_  
   _- return the remaining element on the first queue,_  
   _- swap queues' names._   


## String Manipulation  
 - [x] Strings: Making anagrams 
 > How many deletions needed to make two strings anagrams? 
 
_Insert each char from the first string in the dict (char as a `key` and counter as a `value`), then for each char in the second string subtract the counter and count the number of common letters. Then return:      
 `len(str1) + len(str2) - 2 * numCommonLetters`_ 
 
 - [x] Alternating Characters
 > You are given a string containing characters A and B only. Your task is to change it
into a string such that there are no matching adjacent characters. To do this, you
are allowed to delete zero or more characters in the string.

 - [x] Sherlock and the Valid String
 > Sherlock considers a string to be valid if all characters of the string appear the same number of times.
It is also valid if he can remove just 1 character at 1 index in the string, and the remaining characters
will occur the same number of times. Given a string `s`, determine if it is valid.
If so, return `YES`, otherwise return `NO`.

_Solve using two dictionaries: one for counting letters in the string, the second one for keeping 
information of how many letters (value) appeared at particular frequency (key); e.g.
{3:1, 4:2} means that there is one letter that appears 3 times and two letters that
appear four times._

## Trees  
 - [x] Tree: Height of a Binary Tree 
 - [x] Binary Search Tree: Lowest Common Ancestor
 - [x] Trees: Is this a binary search tree?      
> Check if given tree is a BST.  Assume a node has has attributes: data, left, right 

  _Check recursively with parameters min, max:_ `def isBST(root, min=None, max=None):` _For the right branch set the value of min, for the left branch set the value of max (i.e. nothing in the right branch can be smaller or equal to Min)._      
 _- base case: if not root - Return `True`,_      
 _- if min is not None and `root.data <= min` - Return `False`,_      
 _- if max is not None and `root.data >= max` - Return `False`,_      
 _- check recursively left and the right branches with `root.data` set as max and min respectively._
